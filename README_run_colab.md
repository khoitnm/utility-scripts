# ðŸš— Car Parts Image Generator

This utility script reads a CSV file of **car parts** and generates **game-style futuristic illustrations** for each part using **Stable Diffusion v1.5**.

- Open Google Colab (just use free account): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/
- Create an empty Notebook, then copy script from [./src/utility_scripts/generate_car_parts_gemini_api/main.ipynb](./src/utility_scripts/generate_car_parts_gemini_api/main.ipynb)
- Open Google Drive, upload csv file to the corresponding path that's mentioned in the script (e.g. `/car_parts/06_00_car_parts_fantasy_100.csv`)
  (Note that the root Google Drive folder is `My Drive`, and the script reference it as `/content/drive/MyDrive/`)
- Check the output folder in the script, and create the corresponding folder in Google Drive.
- In Colab menu > Runtime > Change Runtime Type > Hardware accelerator: T4 GPU (we need this to run AI to generate image)
- Then run it.
